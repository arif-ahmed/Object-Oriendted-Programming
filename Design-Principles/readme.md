**Software design principle**: Principle provides us guideline. Principle says what is right and what is wrong. It doesnâ€™t say us how to solve problem. It just gives some guideline so that we can design good software and avoid bad design. Some principles are DRY, OCP, DIP etc. <br>

**Software design pattern**: Pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. Some patterns are factory pattern, Decorator pattern etc.

### Bad Design
* Big ball of mud
* Spider web of dependencies

Bad designs and poor code is not good because it's hard to change. Bad designs are:
* Rigid (change affects too many parts of the system)
* Fragile (every change breaks something unexpected)
* Immobile (impossible to reuse)
