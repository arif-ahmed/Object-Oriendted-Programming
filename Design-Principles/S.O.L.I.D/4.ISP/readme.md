# Interface Segregation Principle

#### What is Interface Segregation?

* Segregate interfaces
* Prefer small, cohesive (lean and focused) interfaces
* Divide "fat" interfaces into "role" interfaces

> "Clients should not be forced to depend
on methods they do not use." - Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices in C#

#### Fat Interfaces
* Classes whose interfaces are not cohesive have "fat" interfaces

```c#
public interface IWorker
{
  void Work();
  void Sleep();
}
```

```c#
public class Robot : IWorker
{
  void Work() { â€¦ }
  void Sleep()
  { 
    throw new NotImplementedException(); 
  }
}
```
